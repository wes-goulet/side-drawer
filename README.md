![side-drawer demo](demo.gif)

## [Demo](https://side-drawer.netlify.com/)

## Installation

You can integrate side-drawer via `<script>` tag or via NPM.

### Via `<script>` tag

In the `<head>` of your index.html put a script tag like this:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://unpkg.com/side-drawer/dist/esm/side-drawer.min.js"
></script>
<script
  nomodule
  src="https://unpkg.com/side-drawer/dist/iife/side-drawer.min.js"
></script>
```

Now you can use the `side-drawer` element anywhere in your html, JSX, template, etc.

### Via NPM

```bash
npm install side-drawer --save
```

And then you need to import the module before you can use it in your html/jsx/template:

```js
import "side-drawer";
```

## Web Component Browser Support

This web component uses [HTML templates](https://caniuse.com/#feat=template), the [shadow DOM](https://caniuse.com/#feat=shadowdomv1), and [custom elements](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1). If you need to polyfill for any of these standards then [take a look at the web components polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs).

## API and Customization

### Attributes/Properties

- `open`
  - Add this attribute to open the drawer.
    - Example: `<side-drawer open></side-drawer>`
  - Set the property in Javascript to imperatively toggle the drawer
    - Example: `drawer.open = true`

### Events

- `open`
  - Raised when the drawer is opened.
  - Example: `drawer.addEventListener("open", handleOpen())`
  - When subscribing in html listen for `onopen`
    - Ex: `<side-drawer onopen="handleOpen()">`
- `close`
  -Raised when the drawer is closed.
  - Example: `drawer.addEventListener("close", handleClose())`
  - When subscribing in html listen for `onclose`
    - Ex: `<side-drawer onclose="handleClose()">`

### Styling

You can style the side-drawer element as you would any regular element, in CSS. A list of supported CSS properties are below, along with the default values.

```css
side-drawer {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  color: inherit;
  width: 350px;
  max-width: 75vw;
  border-top-right-radius: 0;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 0;
}
```

You can customize the overlay that appears to the right of the drawer (when it's open) by setting one of the following CSS variables.

- `--side-drawer-overlay-transition`
  - Sets the transition
  - Default is `opacity 0.25s ease-in-out 0.25s`
- `--side-drawer-overlay-opacity`
  - Sets the opacity of the overlay
  - Default is `0.7`

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a live-server on port localhost:8080. Any changes you make to files in lib/ or any changes to example/index.html should get live reloaded.
